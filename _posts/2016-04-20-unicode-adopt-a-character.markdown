Now you can
[adopt a character](http://unicode.org/consortium/adopt-a-character.html)!

1. Select your character
2. Make your donation

Then you're done. After the donation, your character along with your name will
be listed in
[Sponsors of Adopted Characters](http://unicode.org/consortium/adopted-characters.html).
You support Unicode Consortium by donation while expressing your interests in
the adopted character as
[チルノ adopted ⑨](http://unicode.org/consortium/adopted-characters.html#b2468).

[I chose '유' (U+C720, HANGUL SYLLABLE YU)](http://unicode.org/consortium/adopted-characters.html#bC720),
which is my family name written in Korean. And this is one of the first
adoptions of hangul character.
